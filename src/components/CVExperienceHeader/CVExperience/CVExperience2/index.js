          As Team Leader, I am responsible for managing staff, maintaining
          inventory and overall entail activities to minimise costs whilst
          maximising profit. This is a heavily customer-facing role in which
          customer satisfaction is the main priority. This role has shaped my
          leadership skills through successfully managing teams to complete team
          tasks and reach daily goals.

          Supporting local grassroots communities and causes is an integral part
          of the wider business, as well as an important part of my personal
          self too. I undertook the responsibility of supporting local causes in
          Birmingham through organising community funds for charities and
          customers who make a positive difference in society. A recent example
          of this was working with 'We Go Outside Too', a local charity
          encouraging the young black community to improve their mental health
          through enjoying nature and exercise. We were able to support and
          sponsor their next day trip with the Co-Op community fund, where they
          organised a day to take a group of young people for a waterfall hike.
